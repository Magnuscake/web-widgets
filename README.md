This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The projct was my first jab at React Hooks. Project makes use of the `useEffect`, `useState` and `useRef` hooks.
Components include an Accordion, Translator using the Google translate API, Wikipedia search component and a simple dropdown.
